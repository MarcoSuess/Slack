Dessen Kontaktdaten können Sie dem Abschnitt „Hinweis zur    Verantwortlichen Stelle“ in dieser Datenschutzerklärung    entnehmen.    Wie erfassen wir Ihre Daten?      Ihre Daten werden zum einen dadurch erhoben, dass Sie uns diese mitteilen.    Hierbei kann es sich z. B. um Daten handeln, die Sie in ein    Kontaktformular eingeben.        Andere Daten werden automatisch oder nach Ihrer Einwilligung beim Besuch der    Website durch unsere IT-Systeme erfasst. Das sind vor allem technische Daten    (z. B. Internetbrowser, Betriebssystem oder Uhrzeit des Seitenaufrufs).    Die Erfassung dieser Daten erfolgt automatisch, sobald Sie diese Website    betreten.    Wofür nutzen wir Ihre Daten?      Ein Teil der Daten wird erhoben, um eine fehlerfreie Bereitstellung der    Website zu gewährleisten. Andere Daten können zur Analyse Ihres    Nutzerverhaltens verwendet werden.    Welche Rechte haben Sie bezüglich Ihrer Daten?      Sie haben jederzeit das Recht, unentgeltlich Auskunft über Herkunft,    Empfänger und Zweck Ihrer gespeicherten personenbezogenen Daten zu    erhalten.

Wir behandeln Ihre personenbezogenen Daten vertraulich und    entsprechend den gesetzlichen Datenschutzvorschriften sowie dieser    Datenschutzerklärung.        Wenn Sie diese Website benutzen, werden verschiedene personenbezogene Daten    erhoben. Personenbezogene Daten sind Daten, mit denen Sie persönlich    identifiziert werden können. Die vorliegende Datenschutzerklärung    erläutert, welche Daten wir erheben und wofür wir sie nutzen. Sie    erläutert auch, wie und zu welchem Zweck das geschieht.        Wir weisen darauf hin, dass die Datenübertragung im Internet    (z. B. bei der Kommunikation per E-Mail) Sicherheitslücken    aufweisen kann. Ein lückenloser Schutz der Daten vor dem Zugriff durch    Dritte ist nicht möglich.

Speicherdauer      Soweit innerhalb dieser Datenschutzerklärung keine speziellere    Speicherdauer genannt wurde, verbleiben Ihre personenbezogenen Daten bei    uns, bis der Zweck für die Datenverarbeitung entfällt. Wenn Sie    ein berechtigtes Löschersuchen geltend machen oder eine Einwilligung    zur Datenverarbeitung widerrufen, werden Ihre Daten gelöscht, sofern    wir keine anderen rechtlich zulässigen Gründe für die    Speicherung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten haben (z. B. steuer- oder    handelsrechtliche Aufbewahrungsfristen); im letztgenannten Fall erfolgt die    Löschung nach Fortfall dieser Gründe.    Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung zur Datenverarbeitung      Viele Datenverarbeitungsvorgänge sind nur mit Ihrer ausdrücklichen    Einwilligung möglich. Sie können eine bereits erteilte    Einwilligung jederzeit widerrufen. Die Rechtmäßigkeit der bis zum    Widerruf erfolgten Datenverarbeitung bleibt vom Widerruf unberührt.

Sofern Sie die direkte Übertragung der    Daten an einen anderen Verantwortlichen verlangen, erfolgt dies nur, soweit    es technisch machbar ist.    Auskunft, Löschung und Berichtigung      Sie haben im Rahmen der geltenden gesetzlichen Bestimmungen jederzeit das    Recht auf unentgeltliche Auskunft über Ihre gespeicherten    personenbezogenen Daten, deren Herkunft und Empfänger und den Zweck der    Datenverarbeitung und ggf. ein Recht auf Berichtigung oder Löschung    dieser Daten.

Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung      Sie haben das Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer    personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen. Hierzu können Sie sich jederzeit    an uns wenden. Das Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung besteht in    folgenden Fällen:              Wenn Sie die Richtigkeit Ihrer bei uns gespeicherten personenbezogenen      Daten bestreiten, benötigen wir in der Regel Zeit, um dies zu      überprüfen. Für die Dauer der Prüfung haben Sie das      Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen      Daten zu verlangen.              Wenn die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten      unrechtmäßig geschah/geschieht, können Sie statt der      Löschung die Einschränkung der Datenverarbeitung verlangen.              Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr benötigen, Sie sie      jedoch zur Ausübung, Verteidigung oder Geltendmachung von      Rechtsansprüchen benötigen, haben Sie das Recht, statt der      Löschung die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer      personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen.

Solange noch nicht feststeht, wessen Interessen überwiegen,      haben Sie das Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer      personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen.            Wenn Sie die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten eingeschränkt    haben, dürfen diese Daten – von ihrer Speicherung abgesehen    – nur mit Ihrer Einwilligung oder zur Geltendmachung, Ausübung    oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen oder zum Schutz der Rechte einer    anderen natürlichen oder juristischen Person oder aus Gründen    eines wichtigen öffentlichen Interesses der Europäischen Union    oder eines Mitgliedstaats verarbeitet werden.
